# Challenge: Create an Institute Website

For this challenge, practice using the command line. If you need a reminder of which commands to use to create new folders and files, see [here](cli-reminder.md).

Using the tags we've just reviewed, and two additional ones (see below) begin creating an introductory page for your future Institute.

In your `projects` folder on your desktop, create a new folder called `website`. Create a `index.html` file inside that folder. This will be the homepage or landing page of your site.

Add HTML to your `index.html` file. This page should include the following:

- Doctype
- Root element
- Head and a body
- Title for the page
- One heading
- One paragraph
- One image
- A menu or navigation bar that links to your Home and About pages

Think about the order of your content as you assemble the body of your page.

Don't worry about getting the content just right, as much as using this exercise to review the structure of a webpage, and practice creating a webpage.

## Additional Tags

Here are two additional tags that might come in handy in assembling your page:

To make a list:

```html
<ul>
  <li> item 1 </li>
  <li> item 2 </li>
  <li> item 3 </li>
</ul>
```

(This may come in handy when making your menu or navigation bar.)

The HTML above will produce an unordered (bulleted) list. To create an ordered (numbered) list instead, just substitute `<ol>` and `</ol>` for `<ul>` and `</ul>`.

To make a line break or give space between different elements:

```html
<br>
```

## Further challenge

Finished early? Play around with other tags by referring to this [HTML cheatsheet](http://www.simplehtmlguide.com/cheatsheet.php).
